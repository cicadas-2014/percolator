 ui feedback
-------------

- login and register should be in the top right

- take out signed in successfully

- put "welcome <email> in top right"

- fix log in consistency

- existing problems don't look interactable, needs to be more visible

- posit problem button should be much bigger and more obvious (red button, should be more inviting)

- posit problem form should be styled

- key on the side of the page (graph view)

- MUCH more clarity on the bubble view

- clearer directions as to which fields fill out what

- more feedback on clicks

- put title and description in better places

- once functionality is all in place, 2 priorities:
	- styling...
	- explain to user what to do on the site

- leave bubbles labeled

- center, enlarge bubble view
