- after clicking main percolate link, drop down menues don't function

- problem title text on index fades across the entire screen horizontally

- sometimes it takes a refresh after loading the graphic view

- sometimes clicking upvote/downvote doesn't do anything

- when upvote/downvote works, the icons are replaced by text

- extra scroll space (on my computer) below nodes

- when looking at a problem/solution, extra scroll space contains duplicate of the nodespace

- percolate doesn't leave space for submit button
